Microsoft Copilot Studio is a low-code, graphical development platform used to create and customize AI-powered agents, also known as copilots. Built on the foundation of the former Power Virtual Agents, it allows users to develop conversational AI for internal business processes or external-facing scenarios. 
Key features
Low-code and natural language authoring: Users can build and edit agents by describing what they want in plain language or by using a visual, drag-and-drop editor.
Data integration: Agents can connect to a wide range of data sources to ground their responses and take action. This includes:
Public websites
Internal SharePoint files, Microsoft Graph, and Dataverse
Over 1,800 Power Platform connectors for external services like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and custom APIs
Agent capabilities: You can build different types of agents to suit your needs:
Conversational agents for answering questions and retrieving information.
Autonomous agents that can operate independently, automate tasks, and initiate workflows.
Multi-modal agents that can interact through voice and analyze images.
Multi-channel deployment: Agents can be published across many platforms, including:
Microsoft Teams
Websites and mobile apps
Social media channels like Facebook and WhatsApp
Directly into Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat
Analytics and governance: The platform includes built-in dashboards to monitor agent performance, track user engagement, and ensure data privacy and compliance.
AI customization: For more advanced users, it allows for fine-tuning existing AI models or connecting to Azure AI Foundry to create custom models.
